# 5 Methods of Navigation:

- Left and Right Clicking on Loaded Image
- File Menu Next and Prev Buttons
- Next and Prev Buttons on Screen
- Shift Left and Shift Right Keyboard Shortcuts
- File Chooser Dialogue

# Extra:

- Close keyboard shortcut Shift+X with file menu option
- Next image selection wraps back to the start, going left stops at first image in directory
- Uses file chooser for finding paths to items so it's universial
