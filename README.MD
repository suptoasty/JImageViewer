# 5 Methods of Navigation:

- Left and Right Clicking on Loaded Image
- File Menu Next and Prev Buttons
- Next and Prev Buttons on Screen
- Shift Left and Shift Right Keyboard Shortcuts
- File Chooser Dialogue

# Other:

- Close keyboard shortcut Shift+X with file menu option
- Next image selection wraps back to the start, going left stops at first image in directory
- Uses file chooser for finding paths to items so it's universial
- File chooser has user select image, since selecting a directory is just another uneccessary step to your first image
- File Name is show in the title
- Image is scaled to Content Panel (Fit to screen style), so it scales to a smaller window
- Image can not be larger than displayable are since image is scaled to Content Panel
  
# Note:
- Rescale of image is event based, so it will take the screen a little bit to repaint
